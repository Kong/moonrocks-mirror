   summary = "zlib-compressed file depacking library in Lua",
   detailed = [[
      This is a pure Lua implementation of a depacker for the zlib DEFLATE(RFC1951)/GZIP(RFC1952) file format. zzlib also allows the decoding of zlib-compressed data (RFC1950). Also featured is basic support for extracting files from DEFLATE-compressed ZIP archives (no support for encryption).

      The implementation is pretty fast. It makes use of the built-in bit32 (PUC-Rio Lua) or bit (LuaJIT) libraries for bitwise operations. Typical run times to depack lua-5.3.3.tar.gz on a single Core i7-6600U are 0.87s with Lua â‰¤ 5.2, 0.50s with Lua 5.3, and 0.17s with LuaJIT 2.1.0.
